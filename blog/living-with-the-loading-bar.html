      Today I was playing around with some Stable Diffusion (more on that in a
      future post!) and I realised how impatient I had become to software runs
      taking time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doing Stable Diffusion requires a lot of processing power and when you
      can't scale this without incurring costs (and it being unnecessary to
      scale); then you must wait for the process to complete.
    </p>

      Part of the training I was doing took greater than 30 minutes and
      generating images can take a couple of minutes per run. On the grand
      scheme of things this is not a long time but where I am used to near
      instant feedback on computations it made me reflect on my perception on
      this as a whole.

      In addition, recently we have added a video to one of our products. The
      video takes about 5 seconds to load due to its size. Many of us internally
      noted this delay because of how much it stood out from the norm. We are so
      used to videos loading in seconds. Sites loading in milliseconds. We have
      benchmarks and SEO rankings purely based on page load times. It's so
      ingrained into our psyche now and it wasn't always this way. When we had
      dial-up we would have loved 5 second load times. As technology advances
      and improves we always demand more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a software engineer I pride myself in ensuring I write efficient logic.
      Can I save a few milliseconds here? How can I make it faster to deploy?
      What can I do to reduce cold start times? I'm always trying to find the
      possible improvements to optimise for this vector (amongst others).
    </p>
    <p>
      So naturally when something takes a substantial time it sticks out to me
      like a sore thumb and my mind starts to think on how to optimise it?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the thing is. Do I need to? I'm only running the model a handful of
      times and it's not even that long a duration to wait. Sure if this was a
      production app, used millions of times a day then it starts to make sense.
      But if I spend an hour saving 2 minutes on the run time I've actually lost
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I have a temptation to automate and optimise and I am learning to
      get a balance between action and inaction for these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the best thing to do is wait, take a break and learn to live
      with the loading bar.
