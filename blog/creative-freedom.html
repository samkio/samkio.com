    <h1>Creative Freedom</h1>
    <p>This is my first blog post in my new "creative" website.</p>
    <p>
      Originally my site was a free HTML template that I tweaked to fit my
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>But it had no flair!</p>
    <p>
      I was so caught up in trying to make things perfect that I created a
      boring site and never managed to add anything I want
    </p>
    <p>
      I always thought things had to be 100% perfect, use the latest web
      frameworks, be accessible, have CI/CD pipelines etc.
    </p>
    <p>I lost sight at what the web was for...</p>
    <p>About how I started my journey in the first place...</p>
    <p>So I ripped it all up and started from scratch.</p>
    <p>
      I'm writing the HTML pages directly. I don't even care about styling right
      now or reducing effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      All I care about is having a place to express myself creatively using my
      passion of software development.
    </p>
    <p>This is what I have...</p>
    <marquee><b>And it's liberating. :D</b></marquee>
