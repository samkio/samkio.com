    <h1>Crumble in Minecraft</h1>
    <p>Here is our dog Crumble</p>

      I had the idea of making a homage to him in RTGames Minecraft world
      server.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not the best Minecraft builder however so I spent a lot of time
      thinking of how I would represent him in the voxel game.
    </p>
    <p>
      My initial thought was to create a 3D model of him. Pass it through a
      Voxelizer and then build in on the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      That idea was going to fail though. Taking a 3D model of an active puppy
      was near impossible and even then the end result wasn't really what I
      wanted...
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can see in the above image it is a very big build but the colours
      are off and it's doesn't capture him.

        to turn a still image into a 3D model of him and

        to convert it into Minecraft (and then fixed the colours a bit myself
        manually with creative mode and World Edit.)</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Why was I spending time with this convoluted method when I miss the point
      completely. I want to have Crumble on the Minecraft server.
    </p>
    <p><strong>So why don't I JUST DO THAT?</strong></p>
    <p>So I did, I'm not the best builder but I can try...</p>
    <p>
      And in 2 hours work (including writing this). He is now at the North Pole
      on RT Game's Minecraft Server :)
