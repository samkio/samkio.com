title: Creative Freedom
---

This is my first blog post in my new "creative" website.

Originally my site was a free HTML template that I tweaked to fit my purpose.

But it had no flair!

I was so caught up in trying to make things perfect that I created a boring site and never managed to add anything I want

I always thought things had to be 100% perfect, use the latest web frameworks, be accessible, have CI/CD pipelines etc.

I lost sight at what the web was for...

About how I started my journey in the first place...

So I ripped it all up and started from scratch.

I'm writing the HTML pages directly. I don't even care about styling right now or reducing effort.

All I care about is having a place to express myself creatively using my passion of software development.

This is what I have...

**And it's liberating. :D**
